UTA project 2, programming portfolio

This portfolio is a work in progress. As a student, I am learning the fundamentals of coding and how to apply what I am learning. 
I ask that each person who views this portfolio  check back in over the next 6 months to see how both my Portfolio and I improve. 
As my knowledge and skill grows, my site will improve and I will be leaving notes of what I change in the code so we can watch it grow together.

I have attempted to showcase what I have learned to this point-

*An understanding of HTML * an understanding of CSS and Advanced CSS and how to format what I envision.

In my Portfolio you will learn a little about me and how to contact me. You will also see what projects I am currently working on as they come up.

If you have any questions, or would like to know more about my progress, please feel free to reach out in my Portfolio
