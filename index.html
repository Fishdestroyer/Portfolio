     <h2>A little about myself</h2>
         
     <ul>
           My name is Jeff Whitner and I have been in my current industry for 24 years. The HVAC/R industry has been a very rewarding career and many aspects of it I continuously enjoy and learn
           from on a daily basis. I also get to teach, which is an AMAZING aspect at this point in my career. Unfotunately, I feel this I have come to a stale point in my career- even though I love what I do, it is becoming
           repetitive. To go further up the ladder, I have to gain more knowledge in a different area of the same field, that is why I have chosen coding. There are several areas in  the HVAC/ R field where I can see coding 
           as being a vital and essential part for this industry to technologically grow, from Buildingt Automation to smoother operations flow between the field technicians and office, and that is where I would like
           my coding knowledge to make the bigges impact
